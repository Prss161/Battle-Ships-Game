  <p>Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid here is done automatically by script. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid,
    arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of ship. The ships cannot overlap
    (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player. 
    These may vary depending on the rules. The ships should be hidden from players sight and it's not allowed to see each other's pieces. 
    The game is a discovery game which players need to discover their opponents ship positions.</p>
